## 🫀 **How Does the Human Heart Work?**

The human heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It works in coordination with blood vessels to ensure oxygen and nutrients reach every cell. Here's a simple step-by-step explanation of its working:

1. **Right Side of the Heart:**
   - Deoxygenated blood (without oxygen) from the body enters the **right atrium** (also known as the **right auricle**) through large veins called the **vena cava**.
   - The **right atrium** contracts and pushes blood into the **right ventricle**.
   - The **right ventricle** pumps this blood to the lungs through the **pulmonary artery**, where it gets oxygenated.

2. **Left Side of the Heart:**
   - Oxygenated blood from the lungs returns to the **left atrium** (also known as the **left auricle**) through the **pulmonary veins**.
   - The **left atrium** contracts and sends blood to the **left ventricle**.
   - The **left ventricle**, the strongest chamber, pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body through the **aorta**.

3. **Cycle Continues:**
   - This process repeats continuously, ensuring oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the body while removing waste products like carbon dioxide.

## 🔎 **Key Points to Remember:**
- The heart has **4 chambers**: Right Atrium (Auricle), Right Ventricle, Left Atrium (Auricle), and Left Ventricle.
- **Valves** in the heart prevent blood from flowing backward.
- Blood flows in two loops: **Pulmonary Circulation** (heart ↔ lungs) and **Systemic Circulation** (heart ↔ body).
